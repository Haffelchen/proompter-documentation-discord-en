## `gpt-3.5-turbo`
> **Model versions:**
> - `gpt-3.5-turbo`
> - `gpt-3.5-turbo-0301`
> - `gpt-3.5-turbo-0613`

# Token Price Multiplicator
The token price multiplicator is visible in the [/balance info](<https://discord.com/channels/1100933695986208849/1136860811189551195>) overview. It defines the fee you pay ontop of every used token.


**Base price:** `x1`
> A token price multiplicator of `x1` reflects the exact price of a token. That means, if a token has a base price of `$0.00003`, you will pay that exact price for a token


**Current multiplicator:** `x1.19`
> On top of the token price, you automatically pay a 19% fee. For a token with a base price of `$0.00003`, you get charged `$0.000057`
