### Note
- The `before` and `after` messages are included in the export
- The `max-messages` option counts backwards. If provided, `before-message-id` is the first message, else the most recent message will be
- It then gathers as many messages until either `after-message-id` or `max-messages` is reached. For example, by default `max-messages` is `50`
  - When only `before-message-id` is provided, it will start there, and grab an additional 49 messages older than that one
  - When only `after-message-id` is provided, the most recent message is the first. Additional 49 messages before that will be gathered, unless `after-message-id` is reached. In that case it will stop there
  - When both `before-message-id` & `after-message-id` are provided, it will start at the `before` message, and then gather either 49 more messages, or as many until `after` is hit
